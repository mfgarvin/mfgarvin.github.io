<p>So, Hello there! Youâ€™ve stumbled upon a blog, one upon millions of similar troves of text and thoughts out on the internet. I hope you enjoy your stay.</p>

<p>Just to give an idea of what this site is about - I built this site from scratch as a bit of a programming &amp; coding project over the summer of 2023. Yes, this includes the CSS, so if the styling seems somewhat elementary (or if it breaks, especially on mobile!), thatâ€™s why.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve had this domain for a little while and Iâ€™ve gone through a couple different website hosting services &amp; content management systems, but all in all, I just want this site to be a little place to share a bit about who I am and to share a bit about the projects Iâ€™m working on. There could be some other various thoughts intermingled, though I wouldnâ€™t count on it.</p>

<p>So yeah, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve got going here. Feel free to peruse, browse my code on <a href="https://github.com/mfgarvin">Github</a>, or even say hi over on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mfgarvin">Twitter</a> (or X, or whatever itâ€™ll be called in the futureâ€¦). Thanks for stopping by!</p>
