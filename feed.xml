<p>So, Hello there! Youâ€™ve stumbled upon a blog, one upon millions of similar troves of text and thoughts out on the internet. I hope you enjoy your stay.</p>

<p>Just to give an idea of what this site is about - I built this site from scratch as a bit of a programming &amp; coding project over the summer of 2023. Yes, this includes the CSS, so if the styling seems somewhat elementary (or if it breaks, especially on mobile!), thatâ€™s why.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve had this domain for a little while and Iâ€™ve gone through a couple different website hosting services &amp; content management systems, but all in all, I just want this site to be a little place to share a bit about who I am and to share a bit about the projects Iâ€™m working on. There could be some other various thoughts intermingled, though I wouldnâ€™t count on it.</p>

<p>So yeah, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve got going here. Feel free to peruse, browse my code on <a href="https://github.com/mfgarvin">Github</a>, or even say hi over on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mfgarvin">Twitter</a> (or X, or whatever itâ€™ll be called in the futureâ€¦). Thanks for stopping by!</p>

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
